Button Library for Arduino
==============
Button library v0.1
This library can provide debounced button presses without interrupting other functions in the loop. yay.

It will also allow to recognize multiple button taps (within a short time) and long held buttons.

It builds on ideas used by Jeff Saltzman on arduino forum: http://forum.arduino.cc/index.php?topic=14479.0

Installation
==============
Copy this into your "[...]/MySketches/libraries/" folder and restart the Arduino editor.

*Happy Coding!*
